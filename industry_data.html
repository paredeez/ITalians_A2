<h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>

<p>The three highest ranked IT skills that are not in our required skill set are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA for 2018 and SQL, JavaScript and Microsoft Windows in 2017. Each of the three were ranked highest for skills in their respective years, as our group is all currently studying IT. We will learn SQL more in depth through our Practical Database Concepts course so that is not a problem, for Microsoft Windows in 2017 I believe that most people in today's world especially IT students who have this field as their passion will know the basics at least of Windows functionality. </p>

<h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
<p>The three highest ranked general skills that are not in our required skill set is Writing, Organisational skills and Troubleshooting. They were all the top 3 highest ranked for skills not in our required skill sets from the May 2017 and March 2018 data sets. Writing had 11,456 posts and was ranked 3rd in the 2017 data set and 15,590 and was ranked 4th in the 2018 data set. Organisation skills had 10,933 and was ranked 4th in 2017 where it had 15,844 and was ranked 3rd in 2018. Finally Troubleshooting had 8,693 posts and was ranked 6th where in 2018 it had 11,471 and was still ranked 6th.</p>

<p>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?The groups ideal jobs are all over the data set with demand levels some of us have ideal jobs that are high in demand and some that are not as high, in ways this can be good and bad. Having a job in high demand creates many different occasions where the group members ideal job is vacant but in saying that the job is in high demand therefore creating a more competitive market. The group members with lower demanding jobs will not have as much competition but will have most likely less opportunities for the role. I believe that opinions on the ideal jobs wouldn’t be altered too much as in the end they are our ideal jobs and the reason we are studying IT. </p>
