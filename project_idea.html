  <center><h1>Project idea - Checkmate</h1></center>
  <b>Overview</b>
  <p>Our team project idea is a group organizational application as well as a social media tool that has wider usability for small business task tracking. The application’s core feature allows you to invite group members to collaborate on a project with a moderator assigning tasks to individual members. The tasks can then be broken down into smaller more manageable chunks which then updates all users when a task is complete. The app will also notify members of upcoming deadlines and notify the individual user on what they can do to reach their goal. Checkmate can also be used for recreational purposes allowing users in a group to suggest popular/niche Movies, music, TV shows, books, Games and more to friends, quickly and easily with a swipe of the finger. Organization is key to a successful and happy life and “Checkmate” will help with that.

  <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
  <p>There are some obvious tools/technologies required to build an app, they are a computer that can handle the needs of 
  the app and internet. Then there are some more advanced tools/technologies. Cross platform development tools will be 
  needed as the app will be across many platforms may it be iOS, Android, or Windows. The best cross platform development 
  tool for our group would possibly be Adobe PhoneGap, Adobe PhoneGap is a one code base development tool where you can 
  build the app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs. The way that PhoneGap creates the app is to compile the HTML, CSS etc. files into a 
  directory like creating a website. When the files are run on a device, they access device features through different plugins. The way that PhoneGap develops an app results in a smaller sized app but 
  the quality of the User Interface will depend on the operating system that is running it. PhoneGap comes with a free trial which allows the group to use it and decide if it is right for the job. 
  There are many other different multi-platform development tools. PhoneGap was a very good example. PhoneGap is a coding-based development tool for developers who want full control over the app’s features, there are other 
  tools for low coding like OutSystems which has templates for UI development so little code is needed. There are also simple no code development tools like AppSheet where mobile apps for android and iOS can be made from their own data sources extracted 
  from many different sources where the developer can then edit the branding and features. </p>

  <b>Motivation</b>
  <p>The demand for an application like “Checkmate” is very high as an app that allows people within a group to display and notify what work has been completed and who has completed it isn’t a reality yet. With “Checkmate”, group assignments and projects will be easier to track completion as the simple UI and frequent reminders will motivate and push team members to meet deadlines. The motivation for an application like “Checkmate” comes from prior experiences with working within a group in projects. Some group members are efficient with completing tasks while some fall behind and don’t participate as much which can ultimately halt progression of completion and or can affect the final output of a project. With “Checkmate” the feature of a moderator that assigns tasks with the ability to oversee completion, group tasks will be made easier as all users will see what has been done and what needs to be completed. Once tasks have been completed, instead of messaging a group chat or calling one another, frequent notifications will be sent that will tell all members from a group that a task has been completed. An application like “Checkmate” where progression of projects are easily trackable and mass notified has not been created therefore it has motivated our group to propose and plan the idea for an application that fulfills these needs. The blend of a group organisational application and a social media platform for recreational activities also comes from past experience as we have suggested films, music or tv shows to friends and family and they have forgotten what has been suggested. With “Checkmate”, it will easily display and share with a simple and easy to use user experience. All these elements from our personal experiences have motivated us to propose this project idea.</p>

  <b>Skills Required</b>
<p>Acquiring the skills to complete this project is highly feasible. The skills needed would not be hard to find/ learn, there would be many articles and tutorials on how to create a simple, group list. For the more advanced parts of the list an intermediate understanding of Python is required for the completion of this project, as well as an understanding of user-centred design. Today tutorials and forums are consistently available online to acquire skill in programming as well as troubleshooting.
Good product management is essential in order to grasp the users’ needs, which may include some marketing abilities. These will be needed in order to sell this app’s merit to potentially undecided users and companies who may find other similar applications.</p>

<p>The prototype used to test the layout could be created by using websites like proto.io or any other website or software that allows you to create a prototype app. Swift performance testing will also be required to ensure the consistent viability of the app, which can be filled by a group of people, fulfilling the goal of the app while making it.</p>

<br>
  <br>
  <b>Outcome</b>
<p>The final successful project would be an app that allows the user to use and experience a highly viable and unique but simple group “to-do list” mobile application. 

This app would also be cross-platformed between iPhone and Android in order to broaden its user base. The app will solve the original issue with a group’s potentially poor personal organisation, by improving the organisation of a user it will improve the group’s productivity, trust and efficiency. This increase in productivity will further improve as mental health may improve as well, reflected by the link between organisation and mental health.

The final product would also be able to send notifications to the user to remind them to complete the tasks that they would otherwise forget or store information that they would otherwise forget.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Description</b>
<p>The personal aspect of the to-do list mainly focuses on the individual user. It allows the user to see the tasks that they have for the day. What sets this aspect of the app is the tasks cannot be deleted after being inputted by the user, this is done to commit the user to the task and hold the user accountable by ensuring they complete the tasks that they undertook at the beginning of the day. However, the task can be deleted if they write in a textbox, a reason why they are cancelling the task, while this feature has no practical use, it does hold the user accountable which is the primary goal of this app and fix a prevalent problem in society that is procrastination. The user must first use the textbox at the top of the screen to input a task, once the user presses input the user will be given a warning and confirmation message that after confirming they must complete the task in order to be rid of the task, or at least must provide an explanation of certain character length to delete the task. When the user attempts to delete a task, they will be provided with a large text box where they write a reason for the task to be deleted, and if the text has a character length less than the minimum an error will appear, and the program will be exited and slide the slide the interface back to the main dashboard. On the main dashboard there will be a count of the number of tasks that the user has completed for the day, which will incentivize the user to set quotas and goals for the number of tasks to get done each day. These features are what makes Checkmate unique from previous to-do lists and task apps, is that it actively motivates and encourages the user to complete more tasks which assists in achieving the app’s ultimate goal of improving the overall productivity and motivation of its users.
