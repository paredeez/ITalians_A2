  <h4>What common elements are there, if any? </h4>
  <p>Between all 6 members’ different ideal jobs, the most common element needed for each role is working in a team of sorts - be it small or big, this trait shared between jobs is always required.

Some of the more common elements include customer or client based work, and in an industry like IT that makes sense and can shape the role of a lot of jobs. Other common elements include skills like programming, working with software, or using design and development skills.
</p>
  <br>
  
  <h4>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h4>
  <p>The biggest difference between the ideal positions is the goals of each role - each role has a goal, but each one is different from each other. Though some might take similar skills or use similar work styles, each of these 6 different positions explores a different outcome and can be seen as the biggest differing factor.
</p>
  <br>
  
  <h4>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h4>
  <p>Across the group, there are few similarities in career plans - software development or engineering, gaming or game development etc. 
The least similar of all the roles is most likely the data analyst role, as the work, clients/customers and teams involved differ the greatest between the 6 different ideal jobs.
