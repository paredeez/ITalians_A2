  <h2>Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain</h2>
<h3>What is it and what does it do?</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are an emerging and popular alternative for traditional cash and is ultimately a “digital or virtual currency” and is secured by Cryptography. The currency cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. Bitcoin is the largest and most well known cryptocurrency and is a decentralized and untrackable currency that is protected by blockchain. This means that the transactions made using a decentralized currency like Bitcoin results in safe and secure transactions with no third party system overlooking transactions.</p>

<p>A Blockchain is a “digital record of transactions”. They are used to record transactions of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When a transfer of funds is made with bitcoin, the transaction is checked for reasonableness across other computers and ultimately forms a peer-to-peer network that checks whether it is valid and then is ultimately added to the blockchain. The network of computers is decentralized meaning that another computer cannot add an invalid block to the blockchain.

One of the main ways to earn crypto without paying outright for one is a process called Mining. This process is a way to earn cryptocurrency without putting any money down and all that is needed is a Bitcoin wallet and a working laptop/computer. Crypto mining is done by solving cryptographic equations that outputs a percentage of a certain cryptocurrency. There are now job positions that specialize in mining cryptocurrencies using Crypto Mining Farms. These farms consist of multiple high powered computers that consume a lot of energy and need insulation and air conditioning to prevent these computers overheating. One farm can produce one Bitcoin within 10 minutes if they are powerful enough to compute and solve the cryptographic equations.

The most used cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherueum can be used as a way to pay for goods and services from some of the largest companies and brands. You can purchase Tesla cars, video games, food, drinks and houses using Bitcoin. It is now becoming the new norm to have “Bitcoin to pay” as an option for online sites as big brands accept this currency as a way to pay for goods. It is becoming an alternative way to pay and within three years it will become even more normalised into society. Currently, Bitcoin is worth $68,865 AUD and it is projected to be worth over $400,000 by 2025. This just shows that the wave of cryptocurrency is not coming to a halt will continue to excel and become a mainstream way to pay. 

Ever since the boom of popularity from Bitcoin, other alternative coins named “Altcoins”  have started to come up such as Litecoin, Cardano, VeThor, Tron and Dogecoin just to name a few. Influential people such as Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey have come out and advocated for the cryptocurrency boom and ultimately have caused the prices of some cryptos to increase by a fair amount. After Tesla founder, Elon Musk, announced that he had invested 1.5 billion USD into Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin jumped 17% to $43,000 usd. This showed that the influential have the power to manipulate the prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies and that there is a high demand and interest towards cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to grow and become worth more and more mainstream, the possibility of cryptocurrency being the only way to pay for goods and services doesn't seem too far fetched. This wouldn’t be possible in the near future as the start of the cryptocurrency wave has just started to come into the mainstream. However, more jobs are emerging because of the rise of this currency. From 2018, job listings related to “Cryptocurrency”, “Bitcoin” and “Blockchain have increased by 194%. Examples of jobs that are emerging because of cryptocurrency include Blockchain Data Scientists, Financial Analysts relating to cryptocurrency, Cryptocurrency Traders, Blockchain Web Developers, Technical Writers and Security Architects just to name a few.

The main appealing feature with Cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized meaning that there is no third party overlooking the transactions such as a government body. This however may be tarnished as some regulations made by different countries can halt the wave of crypto. Recently, India has set plans to ban Bitcoin, Dogecoin and other digital currencies. The ban was proposed after the Indian government wanted to create their own digital currency to compete against other private virtual currencies, ultimately they are cornering the market by only having one virtual currency. The Indian government also are planning to give holders of crypto currencies a window of 6 months to liquidate their crypto assets. This will make the price of the biggest coins like Bitcoin dip and drop its value as it is estimated that there is more than $1 billion injected into this market in India. With a lot of money being liquidated, investors in India will be forced to sell equating to a decrease in price. This comes after other countries like China have banned mining and trading. The chinese government has not banned possession of crypto assets however. With governments around the world discussing regulation for the emerging coins like Bitcoin and other Altcoins, the price will plummet eventually. This will then result in an increase of panic buying that will ultimately increase the popularity and price. The future of crypto currencies is hard to predict as governments are unpredictable and have the power to regulate these assets anytime.</p>

<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>I, Sam, have tried to learn more and more about the ever growing cryptocurrencies and have even invested in some coins myself. During the peak of the coronavirus lockdown in Australia, the crypto market was at a steady increase as there was a lot of talk about Bitcoin reaching an All Time Price. When it surpassed its previous all time high of $25,709 in November 2020, I felt like it was the right time to start taking cryptocurrencies seriously and I decided to invest a portion of my weekly pay into coins such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, VET, ChainLink and Cardano just to name a few. Ever since I invested since last year, I have held onto my assets and I have made 5 times the amount I initially invested. With projected figures for the end of 2021, the crypto wallets of myself and others around the world will increase heavily and serious money will be made. 

Cryptocurrencies are exciting as nearly every single coin listed on apps like Coinspot have continued growing in price because of the constant discussion that has arisen because of coins like Bitcoin. For holders like myself, the boom in popularity with Cryptocurrency will financially benefit myself and others and it has so far. The technological advancements that cryptocurrencies have made can benefit people like me and others from making untraceable and trusted transactions because of blockchain technology and will ultimately benefit society for the good. The more discussion of this technology, the more it will increase in price and profit for day traders and casual investors like myself. The crypto market has affected me for the better and within the future, it is possible that all of society will come to accept that cryptocurrencies are legitimate and can benefit technological advancements as a whole. </P>

<h2>Machine learning and neural networks</h2>
Machine learning and deep neural networks are in essence is computer algorithms designed to make decisions about data. They can find faces in photos, translate speech, diagnose medical conditions, from a given data set through a variety of relational models. The overall aim with deep learning algorithms is to Create artificial agents that can solve a wide variety of complex human-relevant tasks in a given environment without a human implemented data set (Bowen Baker 2020). While advanced narrow agents can only do this with a given data set.
Google Deepmind: (2015-2017)
The board game ‘Go’ is considered to be “the most challenging classical game for artificial intelligence because of its complexity” (5). AlphaGo, Deepminds first agent was able to beat a winner of 18 world titles Lee Sedol, in March of 2016. A game where there are approximately 2.1 × 10170 move combinations “more possible move combinations than there are atoms in the universe”. (5) It did this by using an advanced tree search algorithm the ‘Monte Carlo’ in combination with a value network to choose the best possible move from any game position in Go. The Monte Carlo algorithm uses four policies and will continually loop through these until it has identified what it thinks is the best move in a position. 
Selecting: this simply selects a node on a decision tree with the highest probability of winning. 
Expanding: this is used on a selected node and creates a future move set called children nodes. 
Simulating: runs through simulations of future moves called children nodes. Those nodes are then run through a value network, assigning a score for how close it is to the outcome of winning. The objective of the value network is to always maximize the reward (assigned score) and in the case of AlphaGo uses the Markov decision process..
Back- propagation: With the nodes receiving a positive or negative score after a change in move position. The total scores of the parent nodes are updated to reflect if it was the right or wrong move in the position. The implications of which can change the future node selection process. 
Once the algorithm has updated the nodes it will run through the process again, selecting a new node until finally getting a winning result. The algorithm learns what the best possible move is in the simulation stage by initially making random decisions and calculating the difference between the output and what was needed to win the game. AlphaGo had the advantage of training against professional players and receiving a professional game data set, to inform it what human play looks like and to make better move suggestions faster. The more games AlphaGo plays the better informed it will be in selecting the best node to with the game, this is called reinforcement learning.
MuZero (2020 - …) 
Traditionally, tree-based algorithms have achieved enormous success where the environment's dynamics are known to the agent, knowing the rules of the game or having a dataset to define its value network. Therefore, they have no relevance in any environment where these dynamics are unknown. Model-free systems have previously been used to address this issue for visually rich domains such as Atari because these systems estimate what the best policy is rather than a learned model which maps out the entire environment to select the best policy. MuZero, the successor to Google's AlphaGo and more recently AlphaZero aims to tackle one of the biggest problems facing machine learning currently which is to construct an agent with planning capabilities in the pursuit of genuine artificial intelligence 1.(Google deep mind, Abstract)
MuZero uses the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm and incorporates a learned model in its training procedure to achieve ‘superhuman levels’ of success in Chess, Go, Shogi and completed all 57 Atari games without any knowledge of those domains. The learned model focuses on only the important aspects of the environment for planning and decision-making. First It looks at the value of its current position in the game then it decides the best course of action in the position and finally it calculates how good the outcome of the previous move. The agent then stores this information and in training uses it at each step of the Monte Carlo process to limit collecting new data resulting in faster search time per second and improves quality of training over millions of training steps. Infact MuZero used its training data 90% of the time to re-plan what should have been done in past episodes.  7 (Julian Schrittwieser et all Dec 2020) 
<h3>What is the impact?</h3>
<p>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?
As machine learning is becoming more advanced, agents with powerful learning and planning methods can be applied to real-world domains where there exists no perfect simulator. (Julian Schrittwieser et all Dec 2020). With the innovation of MuZero and with IBM predicting “average spending on AI (Artificial Intelligence) will likely more than double in the next three years.” (9. Brian Goehring et all 31 August 2020) It opens the door for greater advancements in most technology-based fields. Fields such as Cybersecurity, content creation as well as recognition and prediction in the stock market. It is predicted that more jobs in cybersecurity could be made redundant with AI having more of an impact in organizations’ cyber security methods. Image a universal agent that can dynamically monitor breach detection, threat intelligence, and compile deep risk analysis. For entertainment and content creation purposes youtuber Tom Scott’s video titled “I asked an AI for video ideas, and they were actually good” uses OpenAI’s GBT-3 text generator agent for exactly that purpose but also highlights how machine learning still can improve. Top Financial firms such as Goldmen Sachs use artificial-intelligence-based solutions for trading and investing (How Machine Learning is shaping the future of investing. 11) powerful machine learning agents in financial markets sorts and stores data generated by clients to outline investment strategies. Fractions of a second count in the stock market so an AI that does this more efficiently gives whoever controls the agent a competitive advantage. Additionally, this can make many people in the financial sector redundant when a machine can do the work in fractions of a second. </p>
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>Machine learning and AI is already utilized heavily in modern technologies that all of us use in our daily life. For Entertainment purposes Netflix / YouTube has a machine learning algorithm that recommends different videos based on what you have seen previously and compares it with other users for an aggregated score. Google recommends products or services to you based on your search history and cookie data gathered from visiting different websites. Allowing advertisers to target you with relevant products. Just do not be like me and search for dog food in Google's search engine unless you want to see advertisements about which pet food is right for your dog that does not exist for a month. After I complete university, I want to travel to Italy to see family. Apps exist such as iTranslate where you can speak to your phone in one language, and it outputs the other (molto bene). The machine learning algorithm in this case will continually improve its suggestions based on how many users it can gather data from. Self-driving car technology has been rapidly improving but still has a long way to go. In March of this year there was a total of 102 deaths recorded on Australian roads (12). Furthermore, a study of road safety concluded “human error was the sole cause in 57% of all accidents and was a contributing factor in over 90%” (13). It is my hope that further advancements in self driving car machine learning algorithms will reach a state where it requires no human input to safely get you from point A to point B. </p>

<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
<h3>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible? </h3>
<p>Cybersecurity practices are put in place to protect an individual or organisation from cyberthreats and unauthorized access to data and other computerized systems, a strong cybersecurity strategy can provide protection form malicious attacks against a system which stores personal information where they can alter, delete, extort, or access. With the number of online users increasing daily the evolution of cybersecurity is required due to the extra data that is being put out there, data that is confidential or sensitive to the user. Cybersecurity can also prevent attacks designed to disable or disrupt systems or devices operations. The main “state of the art technology” for cybersecurity would be the development of cloud storage, cloud storage of data is the easiest and safest way to store date in today’s world other than storing data in external hard drives. Every cloud security measure is set to achieve one or more of the following goals Data security allows implementation of barriers and encryption between the sensitive information and the threat, identity and access management which manages the authenticity of the user attempting to reach data, governance this tracks and traces the threat along with prioritizing the threat based on severity, Data retention and business continuity planning which is the technical recovering plans that are put in place for data recovery like backups etc, finally legal compliance which revolves around protection of private data from the government. Cybersecurity practices can be divided into 9 different sections those are application security, information or data security, network security, disaster recovery/ business continuity planning, operational security, cloud security, critical infrastructure security, physical security, and end- user education. Multiple software’s can be installed onto devices to help protect from cyberthreats for example anti malware and virus software, this allows the individual to protect themselves from any random threats due to website pop up ads with hidden threats etc. tools to protect oneself from cyberthreats are identity and access management, Firewalls, endpoint protections, antimalware, intrusion prevention/ detection systems, data loss prevention, endpoint detection and response, security information and event management, encryption tools, vulnerability scanners, virtual private networks, cloud workload protection platform and cloud access security broker. To get these tools popular vendors are Check Point, Cisco, Code42, McAfee, Microsoft and many more. The main and simplest ways that one can protect themselves from cyber-attacks is always use strong unique passwords, do not click suspicious links, watch out for Phishing scams these are when an attacker poses as a familiar contact attempting to lead the recipient into a trap, keep up with updates from your different accounts about your recent activities and ensure that you are constantly backup devices in case of total attack or need to shut down devices for good and setup two step authentication for you accounts if possible this means not only use a password also use things like security questions or sometimes phone numbers to prove that it is you accessing the account. Cybersecurity looks to continue to build on the cloud secure storage of data soon to protect from cyberthreats, they intend to consolidate the information, so it is still protected but easily obtained. The focus for cybersecurity is creating an easier experience when it comes to keeping one’s information or machines safe and protected from unknown threats. Machine learning is a major development coming to cybersecurity, AI that can predict the behaviour that is needed. Currently big organisations are still focusing on keeping databases secure from threats, protection cloud data and attempting to implement strong password protocols onto users to make them safer. Virtualised firewalls, virtualised intrusion detection and preventions systems are being implemented into cloud technologies to provide safer and secure cloud storage of data. Another practice that is being developed is hardware authentication, the computer company Intel have begun to used technology where it combines hardware enhanced factors to authenticate the user’s identity. User-behaviour analytics are being designed so that if an attacker breaches a user’s system and begins to show different behaviour patterns than the original user this will send red flags allowing the user to catch the attacker and prevent anymore breaches. Not only is the number of users coming online constantly increasing the cyber attackers’ practices are evolving and becoming more sophisticated this means that the cybersecurity industry is constantly evolving with new technologies to combat. </p>
<h3>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? 
Benefits and impacts of having proper cybersecurity practices in place are business protection against cyberattacks and data breaches against personal and private systems, protection for data and networks, prevention of unauthorized user access, improved recovery time after a breach that breaks through, protection for end users and endpoint devices, regulatory compliance, business continuity and improved confidence in the company’s reputation and trust for developers, partners, customers, stakeholders and employees. Impact from cyber-attacks in Australia has been said to cost roughly 29 billion dollars every year as it costs a lot of money to recover from security attacks and data recovery. Mostly everything with cybersecurity will change in some minor and some larger ways as time progresses with the evolution of technology and security needs. Most common people to get hit with cyberattacks are people who do not know how to properly protect themselves and their systems, also the big business organisations because their data can be used for money or other benefits for the attacker. A large impact will be the massive inflation in cyber security jobs opened and needed to be filled, therefore increased career opportunity within the IT industry which is an already massive and continuously growing pathway. This is will also mean increase in IT students, which also makes more money for universities. Having more students and more money coming into universities means more resources can be bought along with extra funding for research and experiments into all fields but also IT and cyber security systems and technologies. 
How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
Having easier and safer ways to store data and other services will not directly affect me and my family as we have never been through a cyber attack of any large way. However, as I intend on going into the IT industry for a career, I will need to keep information for my job secure so having the knowledge and easier means to do so will vastly help. My preferred field of career is the gaming industry, using proper and efficient cyber security measures will be crucial for keeping the early development of games and other media secret from the world, the gaming industry is prone to cyber-attacks as there is constantly extreme fans that want to know every detail of games etc before they are officially released ruining the experience for others. Using cloud storage methods will not only help with any cyber threat protection but it will also help with preventing data loss like assignments and other schooling materials used in an IT degree. The only person that using cyber security techniques and technologies will affect is my sister as she has recently started a beautician business so her payment records and client information could be safely and easily stored in a cloud where it will have the developing protection from threats. 

Clouds,Services,Servers 
Cloud computing is the Ability to deliver on demand computing services over the internet. Cloud computing allows storing and accessing files over the internet then saving them on local storage devices. Cloud computing can be split into two different models: the Deployment model and service model.

The Deployment model
The deployment of cloud computing includes the public clouds, private clouds and hybrid clouds. 
Public clouds 
Public clouds are accessible to everyone and have vast amounts of available space. The infrastructure is available through the internet and is owned by a cloud provider examples of cloud providers include google or amazon. However, this means that public clouds are strictly under control by the cloud provider This is a downside because they rely on the cloud provider to stay stable and risk vulnerable security, which can expose users. 
Due to the versatility of public clouds, it's often used collaboratively or used to develop various software applications. The "pay as you go" model means there are significantly fewer costs in hardware and software maintenance. 

Private clouds
A single organisation behind a firewall solely controls these cloud infrastructures however can be managed by a third party off/on-premise. Private clouds are often the preferred choice of businesses to allow authorised users only to store and access data from the private cloud. Private clouds allow for strict security control and can move around data without interfering with the company's infrastructure. 
The downside to such freedoms is that it's the most expensive deployment model and is not as versatile as the public cloud option as it can only be expanded and scaled by adding more hardware and storage.

Hybrid cloud
This deployment model is a combination of both public and private clouds, which interact seamlessly together. Hybrid clouds have many benefits, including the ability to have the secure infrastructure of private clouds and the versatility of public clouds.
The service model
The cloud service model includes three service types. IAAS, PAAS and SAAS
IAAS
Used by IT Administrators, an IaaS provides a basic computing infrastructure and is available on the “pay what you use” model. 
PAAS
Software developers often use this platform-based service as it provides an environment for testing and maintaining developed applications. 
SAAS
This model is a “pay as you go” type model managed and maintained by the provider; that way, the end-user/customer isn’t required. 

Clouds are used for… 
- data backup
- data recovery 
- email
- virtual desktops 
-software development
- software testing
- data analytics 
-customer-facing web applications
